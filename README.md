##This is pretty simple.

So, [Joe](https://twitter.com/jswny) [Sweeney](https://github.com/jswny) and I live together. By nature that means we spend a lot of time together, and inevitably, as programmers, we always have ideas. Oft, you'll hear us say to each other "You know what we should make..." and then rattle off some half thought out often unfeasible idea.

In light of this, we've decided to make this repository, make a list and public record of all the sh:collision:t we said we should make. To be clear, most of these ideas will be without code and without substance. Most will simply be a name and a one line explanation of the idea. Because we're passionate about what we do you're free to take any of these ideas and make them yourself. The reason we have these in the first place is because they don't exist, so the best possible outcome would be to see them come to fruition :muscle:.

##The ideas :thought_balloon:.

Below, find a list of some truly brilliant, and truly idiotic ideas :trollface:.

1. *[Yik Yak](https://yikyak.com/home) Reverse Trends*: hijack and reverse Yik Yak to produce a public API. Use this access to parse data coming from across the United States to query for places where trends began and then track them over time. I.E. "Netflix and Chill," look at where it began geographically based on Yik Yak usage and follow it into widespread proliferation.

2. *[Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/) geo-filters auto-generator.* Joe made a custom filter for Oak Hall @UMass. He used a standard bow/ribbon graphic. This generator would use that standard asset and then take two inputs, the text to overlay and a color. Upon run it would spit out a standardized graphic with the appropriate color and text that could then be submitted as a geo-filter.

3. *External [GitHub](https://www.github.com) dashboard.* Amid recent [controversy](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11049067) regarding GitHub and it's relationship with the developer community many people are suggesting that they might move away from GitHub. This is all fine and dandy, but what about our COMMIT STREAKS :scream_cat::rage2:? I simply refuse to let them die and languish, to be writing code every d:shit:mn day and not get credit for it! Instead, what we propose is an externally hosted service that one includes in the git head/header and which gets notice of every commit made. This would be a platform agnostic and self-hostable service that would generate a GitHub-esque commit graph so that you can show off your coding chops and not have to worry about being overly committed to the big O.G. :octocat:.

4. *Cross me and your f:exclamation:cked license.* This is pretty self explanatory, it's a much simpler license that basically is just a modified version of the current MIT license. It allows for very liberal taking of content, but unlike Creative Commons which requires you to provide credit, our license forces you to either provide credit or get dropped. Put simply, you either provide an original reference for where the idea came from or you cut off and you can never borrow/take/fork from there again. Simple. Legalese.


##License.

Pretty clearly, none of these ideas have come to fruition yet. We're posting this repository with an MIT [license](LICENSE.md) so that you can take any of these ideas and do what you may with them.
